                            looking at does not show a price, it means that manufacturer has asked us not to price it on
                            the site. <br><br>You will need to contact the sales department for your price. Our pricing
                            is kept in databases and is updated as soon as we receive information about any changes from
                            manufacturers. Please contact our <a href="mailto:Sales@pnwx.com" title="Sales@pnwx.com"

                    <h3>Web Site Hosting Services</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>We are our own Internet Service Provider. We also provide co-location and web serving
                            for other businesses both in and out of the Radiology Community. Our own servers sit on
                            racks in our climate
                            controlled network room right here in our head office in the East Portland Oregon Metro
                            Area. All systems are UPS
                            power protected, with the UPS systems backed up by auto-starting and transferring generation
                            systems. This allows
                            us to be <b>100% in control</b> of our site and keep it up and running
                            with excellence!<br><br>
                            Being our own provider also keeps us from being limited to a certain sized site - or being
                            forced to use web
                            authoring programs like Front Page, as so many other sites are hosted in the Radiology
                            industry. If we need
                            additional server power or features, we just slide another server into our racks and it's
                            ready to serve.
                            <br><br>Furthermore, we are not forced to use a seriously overloaded server at some bulk
                            hosting company that also
                            hosts adult and other questionable sites that are then filtered or blocked by a lot of ISP's
                            to protect their
                            customers from the objectional content. Without all these problems, our sites remain fast,
                            responsive and
                            available to you, our customers, <b>24/7</b> for all your needs, at any
                            time that is the most
                            convenient!<br><br><b>We can host your website on our servers.</b>We
                            specialize in radiology
                            related websites. If you are a radiology
                            manufacturer, we can work with you to host your site free of charge in exchange for our
                            being able to market your
