                            <p>We can arrange for inside delivery to customers who do not have a freight dock or
                                forklift. However, it is the buyers responsibility to discuss any special delivery
                                requirements with your Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. sales representative at the time of
                                order.</p>

                            <p>Many products such as lead apparel require no special assistance to setup and use them.

                                items, such as film processors, do require some assembly, setup and technical know-how

                                make use of them.</p>

                            <p>But in no way do we offer services to help the customer un-crate, assemble or otherwise
                                make
                                use of the products purchased from us. Often times you can find local professionals in

                            <p>Finally, some items, such as x-ray generators, require certain licenses from several
                                different government entities. This also is the buyers responsibility. Usage of x-ray
                                equipment on live humans without the proper credentials and/or licenses is a serious
                                crime
                                in many countries.</p>

                            <p>By purchasing such products, you are representing to us that you have, or intend to

                            <p>And in the case of "customized" items such as markers with initials, lead garments that have
                            been either monogrammed or made to customers specification, no refund will be issued at all.</p>

                            <p>Pacific Northwest X-Ray highly recommends to international customers that they contact a
                            customs broker in their area and find out before ordering what duties and taxes may be, as
                            we have no control over those fees, and they are the responsibility of the buyer. Also, be
                            aware that some freight carriers charge a brokerage fee on top of the duty and taxes.</p>

                            <p>Due to the nature of our products, changes or cancellations to an order can only be accepted
                            the day the order is placed, and may require written notice of such action. However, "rush"
                            or same day shipping of an item per the customers request, is an exception to this policy,
                            and NO changes or cancellations are accepted.</p>

                            <p>Any "authorized" product return is subject to a restocking fee! This amount will range from
                            20% to as much as 50%, depending on the manufactures policies. In addition, the customer is
                            responsible for all freight charges in both directions. Returned products MUST be in new
                            condition with all shipping cartons/manuals/packaging in place, and be accompanied by a
                            "return authorization" number. If not, additional charges may be assessed, and/or the return
                            may be rejected. In the event we are forced to reject your return, you will be responsible
                            for the freight charges to return the product back to you once again.</p>

                           <p> Many of the items we sell are special order or custom manufactured to your specifications.
                            Examples of this are the lead markers and lead aprons. All such products are NOT returnable!
                            It is your responsibility to ask before ordering a product from us, if that particular item
                            is a "special order" item, and therefore will not be returnable later on if you wish to do
                            so. No returns, which are "authorized", will be accepted after 30 days from the shipment
                            date of your product.</p>

                            <p>It is important to note that Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc, manufactures very little of what
                            we sell. Warranties are between you the purchaser and the manufacture of the products you
                            purchase. We will do everything we can to assist you in any and all warranty claims
                            including repair/replacement. But the process by which any warranty situation is handled is
                            determined by the manufacture and not Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</p>

                            <p>Also, we <b> DO NOT </b> provide any assistance with warranty issues arising on merchandise which was
                            sold and/or taken outside of the United States. In these situations, we will provide contact
                            information for the manufacture and nothing more! In any case, all freight charges arising
                            from returns, exchanges, service or anything else is the sole responsibility of the
                            purchaser.</p>
